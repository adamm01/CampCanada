# Camp Canada

## My Inteded Audience

My intended audience is visitors over the age of 18+, the reason for this is because the trips of camp canada is only ages over 18+, although the trips are only over 18+ and aimed at that age range audience the website os sill for every age becasue the ounger ages could be looking to go in the future. Another audience this is aimed a is people looking for an adventure, seking to do activities, camp canada has many activities to compleate and an amazing experience.

## What we are doing

We are creating a website for 'Camp Canada', this includes designing. Designing is a key stage of the project, this helps with development because the developer will have the knowledge of what to create and how it will work. This also includes the development stage, the development stage consists of creating the website based off the designs, then later on fixing the problems and documenting each stage also how you fixed it.

## What I am aiming to achieve

I am aiming to achieve a fully working website in the specified time frame, also with many designs leading up to this website, clearly showing stages of development, improvment and mistakes. The develment of the site will have to include full documentaion of the stages and information needed, including reasoning and points.

## Constraits

One main constraint is the time, time plays a big role in the whole project, having to compelate specific taks in a limited time applies pressure, also having to include alot of detail in this time makes it more difficult. Having to include many features makes this a problem and having limited knowledge makes this harder as ack of knowledge means that research will have to be made.


## Benefits

One benefit is that although I don't have a wide knowledge i will be learning new skills to help me achieve this goal in the time frame, this means another benefit will be managing my time effiency and learning skills in a limited time to be compleated in at an acceptable standard. One other benefit is that I will be resenting important informaion to the visitors of the website helping them get to where they want to be in the most efficient way possible.

## Nature of interactivity

I will have many interactive features on my website, one feature will be buttons, the buttons will have one of the more important roles in the website, matching the design, getting visitors to the palces thay want to be in the least amount of searching as possible. Another will be the images, the images will be clickable to take the user to another location, this is time saving and efficient for the audience while displaying information at he same time. The scroll feature will be an interactive feature also, being able to browse the website with a constant scroll and also being responsive at the same time.

## Complexity of Website

I have aimed to create my website with the most simple desing possible with the easiest navigation and easily access information to the visitors,. My costant scroll feature  makes everything one one page of what the infrmation needed is presented in a long strip of information, with clear buttons to navigate round the website, while showing images at the same time.
